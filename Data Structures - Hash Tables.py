# poem.txt Contains famous poem "Road not taken" by poet Robert Frost.
# You have to read this file in python and print every word and its count as show below.
# Think about the best data structure that you can use to solve this problem and figure
# out why you selected that specific data structure.
#  'diverged': 2,
#  'in': 3,
#  'I': 8


# Using a dictionary to keep track of the key values pairs is the best data structure to use
poem = "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference."

# Implement hash table where collisions are handled using linear probing.
# We learnt about linear probing in the video tutorial.
# Take the hash table implementation that uses chaining and modify methods to use linear probing.
# Keep MAX size of arr in hashtable as 10.
# Solution
